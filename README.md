This is a sample of cartographic visualizations I created in 2021 at UN-Habitat for the Moscow Voluntary Local Review on the progress towards the SDGs implementation. They are published as an [interactive map in Foursquare Studio](https://studio.foursquare.com/public/761de512-4d24-4acc-99ae-3e7bf93f2bf5), a geospatial analysis tool based on [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl).

To create these maps, statistical data were gathered from government agencies and open sources, analyzed and systematised in cohesive datasets corresponding to each SDG. Data harmonisation included cleaning and unifying varying file formats, measurement units and time periods. The harmonised data were then transformed into a spatial format using spatial join and geocoding operations.

Various mapping techniques were used to show the results of the geospatial analysis of 146 Moscow's districts:
- Choropleth maps
- Heatmaps
- Hexagon maps

## List of selected indicators
SDG 1 - No Poverty:
- Recipients of utility subsidies, % of the district's population

SDG 3 - Good Health:
- Road accident fatalities density
- Open sportgrounds per 100,000 people

SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities:
- Housing Affordability, years to save up for a 54 sq m flat
- Rental Affordability, % of monthly rent from salary
- Urbanized area, % of the built-up area from the total district's area
- Cultural Heritage Sites per district
- CCTV cameras density
- Street lights density

SDG 13 - Climate Action:
- Share of treecover in the total district area
